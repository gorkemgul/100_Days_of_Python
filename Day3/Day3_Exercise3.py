# ========================================================================= #

# We're going to write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year.
# A normal year has 365 days, Leap years have 366 with an extra day in February.
#  This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year;
# - on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
# - ** except ** every year that is evenly divisible by 100
# - ** unless ** the year is also evenly divisible by 400
# e.g. The year 2000: 2000 / 4 = 500 (Leap), 2000 / 100 = 20 (Not Leap), 2000 / 400 = 5 (Leap!)

year = int(input('Which year do you want to check? '))

if year % 4 == 0:
    if year % 100 == 0:
        if year % 400 == 0:
            print('Leap year.')
        else:
            print('Not leap year.')
    else:
        print('Leap year.')
else:
    print('Not leap year.')
